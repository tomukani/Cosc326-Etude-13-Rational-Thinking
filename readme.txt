Hello
Currently this submission contains a working Integer class , and our Rational can add values, and subtract values. Multiplication in theory should work but in practice is not. Our approach to solving fractional will be using our Integer operations to calculate the Rational Arithmetic shown in the link below.




navigate to directory and type

compiles to c++98 by default so set compiler to the latest standard
g++ *.cpp -std=c++0x -o rational

to run
./rational

to feed a file into the executable
./rational < test.txt
The program will ask for two numbers

We used this wikipedia page to help with implementing Rational arithmetic
